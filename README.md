# PowerTool
The idea behind this is to create a IT Helpdesk Tool for troubleshooting remote (and local) workstations.  

This is the GUI menu for the IT Helpdesk Tool.  Once connected to a workstation it will populate the full list of drop down menus.

Running PowerTool.ps1 will start open the main menu.
Type in a local workstation name or IP address and click Connnect.

PowerTool.ps1 calls functions from the Function directory and the scripts from the Scripts Directory.
